# How to setup the python environment

1. Have a code editor for Python, I personally use PyCharm from Jetbrains, you could use VSCode and install its Python extensions

2. Clone the repo `https://github.com/aexko/mchacks12.git`

3. Go into the repo with `cd mchacks12`

4. Create your python environment:
    - Open terminal and run `python3 -m .venv`
    - Activate your environment by running `source .venv/bin/activate`
    - Upgrade `pip` (Python's package management system) by running `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`
    - Install the dependencies by running `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
